you want the graph to show ranking by age, meaning to show different players rankings
when they had the same age.

right now your data is like this:

date | ranking | player_id | player_dob

for each of these, you can figure out how to get the
player's age by subtracting player_dob from date

given two players, you want to map their rankings from
a starting age to an ending age.

you need to determine the min and max ranking dates
given an age and a player's dob, can you find the first ranking date when the player will turn this age?
given an age and a player's dob, can you find the last ranking date when the player will exceed this age?



i want to construct a query such that in my WHERE clause, 

I can compare a column to the value returned by a function on another column.

how do i do this???



MAP EACH PLAYER'S RANKING TIME TO THEIR AGE AT THAT TIME
THEN YOU CAN PLOT
